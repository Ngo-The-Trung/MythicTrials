This is a WIP mod for the game Rift Wizard
This requires the current beta branch (if you're on steam, right click game -> Properties -> Betas then select the latest beta)
Mod support in Rift Wizard is quite barebone right now so don't expect this to work in conjunction with other mods

### Features
Add a 2 new trials. More to come

```
Danse Macabre
All enemies have Touch of Death
All non health/mana potion consumables are replaced with Death Dice
Mordred is weaker but can only take damage from Death Dice
Mordred: has no shield and 0% dark resist. Planar Interposition cooldown increased to 25s.
```

```
Drunken Mage
All health potions replaced with Vodka. This heals you but randomizes your skills.
All mana potions replaced with Whiskey. This randomizes your spells and upgrades.
Whiskey can only reroll damage spells to damage spells (sorcery or non-enchantment conjuration spells) and non-damage spells to non-damage spells. This is just a small safeguard to prevent you from rerolling your entire kit into enchantments.
The number of upgrades you get will be the same afterward. You won't get spells with so few upgrades that you end up losing upgrades.
```
